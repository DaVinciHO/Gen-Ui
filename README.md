# Gen-Ui
My experiments and explorations with GenUi

I have been training an LLM (v0) with design guides and guardrails, to produce UI for Sky Glass TV.

I have uploaded some interesting results here. This is still a discovery stage where it is being refined continuously. 

To improve the user experience, I decided to develop and Frontend and Backend server, so instead of going on v0's website to generate outputs.
I created a nice home screen on which an input can be added by text or voice, which will than create a UI output.
The Frontend and Backend was developed with the help of ChatGPT.
